                <h2>Facts about Boxing</h2>
                <p>
                    Boxing is a combat sport with ancient origins, dating back to ancient Greece, and is part of the
                    modern Olympics since
                    1904. It is governed by rules, including the Queensberry Rules, which divide matches into rounds and
                    dictate scoring by
                    points, knockouts, or technical knockouts. Modern professional and amateur matches are often shorter
                    and have more
                    rounds compared to ancient contests.

                <h1>History and evolution</h1>

                Ancient origins: Fist-fighting contests have existed since prehistoric times, with the earliest visual
                evidence
                appearing in 3rd millennium BCE Sumerian relief carvings. It was an Olympic event in ancient Greece
                starting in 688 BCE.
                Modern rules: The modern version of the sport was established with the Queensberry Rules, which
                introduced gloves and
                timed rounds, a stark contrast to earlier bare-knuckle fighting.
                Olympic inclusion: Boxing has been a permanent fixture in the modern Summer Olympics since 1904, though
                it was
                temporarily banned in Sweden in 1912. Women's boxing was added to the Olympics starting in 2012.</p>
